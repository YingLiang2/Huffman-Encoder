# Huffman Encoder

## General Info
- This project is to simulate the Huffman Encoding algorithm. 

- This project was made for my COMP 2150 class, which was my object oriented programming class, therefore it 
the structure of this project has elements of OOP. <br> The main focus was to learn the syntax of JS but also to incorporate OOP elements
for me to create the Huffman Encoder algorithm.


## Prerequisites
- Please have the latest version of node.js installed

## Compilation / Running

1. To run the huffman encoding project. You must first have all the files in the same directory.

2. The default filename is "hamlet.txt". Please change the filename to the textfile that you will encode
in the Main class, by the variable fileName.

3. Finally to run the code type into the command prompt in the same directory: **node.exe Main.js**

4. Then you should get a "hamlet.txt.huff" file which is an encoded file of the hamlet.txt

5. To run the test type into the command prompt: **node.exe Tests.js**
    - You shouldn't get any error messages or warnings as the tests are to use the data structure that we implemented.
